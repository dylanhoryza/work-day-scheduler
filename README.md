# work-day-scheduler
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to be able to use dayjs and local storage to save data in timeblocks that correspond with real time
- I built this project to continue to expand my knowledge on JavaScript, JQuery and how to incorporate third party APIs
- This application solves the problem of having a functional work day scheduler to keep myself organized throughout the day.
- I learned a lot more about JavaScript and how to use third party APIs by reading their documentation.
